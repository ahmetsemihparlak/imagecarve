This program is for early adoptors running on linux only at the moment.

There's nothing hugely linux specific (hey, it may even compile in a
cygwin environment), but I just haven't tested it.

To compile:
  make

To use it: (assuming you have netpbm installed)

  cat image.png | pngtopnm | pgmtopgm | ./imagecarve -t3.2 -s1 -
